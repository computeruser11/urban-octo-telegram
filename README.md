# Code Refactor Starter Code
This is the webpage for Horiseon. It has three hyperlinks that link to sections on the same webpage. I fixed 
a hyperlink titled Search Engine Optimiazation, which did not work at first. The link to the deployed application 
is https://computeruser11.github.io/urban-octo-telegram/#search-engine-optimization.

![Fixed link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78623420/107887710-edf38a80-6ebc-11eb-84fc-cd1d6c53374a.png)
The above image shows the link that got fixed.

The above images shows the paragraphs that got altered to look like the paragraphs on the mock-up page.
